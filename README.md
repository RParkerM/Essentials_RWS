# Essentials

Essentials is a package of must-have features for all C&C Renegade servers running Dragonade. Essentials aims to extend features and API of Dragonade without modifying it's code.
Essentials comes with useful, extremely configurable and easy to use commands, features and APIs for developers.

## Features

### Holograms API
Essentials provides a simple API to create text holograms in maps at custom locations and handles object events for developers. Holograms spawns an invisible soldier and uses it's player name display to create holographic texts in the map.

### Bad Word Filter
This feature checks messages sent by players for bad words, then warns players if their messages contained a bad word and optionally kicks after configurable amount of warnings.

### Crate Injector
This feature takes control of Dragonade's crate spawning logic and spawns configurable power-ups at crate spawn locations. These power-ups can do Dragonade's default crate logic when they are picked up, or can do it's original power-up behavior. This feature is useful if you are looking to spawn special power-ups at crate spawn locations or want to randomize crate models.

### Grunt Effect
This feature plays grunt sound with small camera shake as seen in Single Player.

### Map Holograms
This feature utilizes Essentials' Holograms API and creates holograms in maps defined by their map names in configuration.

### Jukebox
Essentials comes with a very advanced Jukebox feature, allowing players to create their own playlists that persists between maps with loop modes and shuffling.
